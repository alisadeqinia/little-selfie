# Little Selfie App
> The idea for this app came from Joey Lee's app, called Data Selfie App. But it has more functions! 
> Here I am is a little web application that allows you to submit an image of your self along with your geolocation. This app is a nice starting point for other self-tracking applications or just a standalone application to create a collection of "dataselfies" with some extra metadata.
